** Alda is a text-based music composition language
** You can write your scores in a text format, as an alternative to traditional
   sheet music. And I believe that there are benefits to writing music in a text
   format, which I'll describe shortly.
** Currently, the focus is on MIDI. Alda will play your scores using the MIDI
   synthesizer that's built into the Java Virtual Machine. Or you can use Alda
   to export a MIDI file, which you can do a lot of useful things with, such as
   importing it into a DAW, or importing it into a sheet music notation program
   if you want to convert your Alda score into traditional sheet music.
** I do have some grand plans for the future that involve stepping outside of
   MIDI and playing around with waveform synthesis and samplers and all of the
   fun that that entails.

== Data, calculations, actions

A common pattern in FP is to start by coding data, then calculations, then
actions. Eric Normand talks about this in his recent book, Grokking Simplicity.

We can see how this approach is beneficial when using a functional programming
language to generate music. We can generate the data, observe and test it before
we play it (the action part). Furthermore, we can derive other data (musical
phrases, etc.) as calculations with the original data as input.

* Data: a list of daily high and low temperatures

* Calculation: a function of temperatures -> music data

* Action: playing the music data
